## ABOUT ENGINEERING EXPLORATION:
The opportunity to explore materials and discover their potential is constantly evolving. An inquisitive and curious mind is needed to ensure that materials continue to push creative boundaries while still remaining functional under the decorative we deal with the project using components of mechatronics.

The goal of this module is to move from defining the problem to designing a solution. We begin by learning about the exploration phase, and we will exit this phase with a number of design concepts for peer review. We also learn how to decompose a design to evaluate its overall function, and essential process in creating good design essential to the life of our design. Finally, we learn how to critically examine past design artifacts to inform our current concepts so that we can sensibly differentiate our product.

From this we build trust among our team mates, which also helps in the personality development and with individual self confidence and co-ordination among us.

### NEED STATEMENT
Some industry is in need of a bot which can deliver different items to employees and workers.
### INTRODUCTION
A robot is a machine, especially one programmable by a computerâ€”capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. A robot can be guided by an external control device, or the control may be embedded within. A robot can execute one or more number tasks with speed and precision. A robot maybe autonomous or semi-autonomous. A delivery robot is an autonomous or semi-autonomous robot that provides delivery services. An operator may monitor and take control of the robot remotely in certain situations that the robot cannot resolve by itself such as when it is stuck in an obstacle.
