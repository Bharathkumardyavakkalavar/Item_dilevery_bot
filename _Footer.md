## ABOUT ENGINEERING EXPLORATION:
The opportunity to explore materials and discover their potential is constantly evolving. An inquisitive mind is needed to ensure that materials continue to push creative boundaries while remaining functional under the decorative we deal with the project using mechatronics components.

This module aims to move from defining the problem to designing a solution. We begin by learning about the exploration phase, and we will exit this phase with several design concepts for peer review. We also know how to decompose a design to evaluate its overall function and essential process in creating good design essential to the life of our design. Finally, we learn how to critically examine past design artifacts to inform our current concepts so that we can sensibly differentiate our product.

From this, we build trust among our teammates, which also helps in personality development and individual self-confidence and coordination among us.

### NEED STATEMENT
Some industry needs a bot that can deliver different items to employees and workers.
### INTRODUCTION
A robot is a machine, especially one programmable by a computer—capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. A robot can be guided by an external control device, or the control may be embedded within. A robot can execute one or more number tasks with speed and precision. A robot is maybe autonomous or semi-autonomous. A delivery robot is an autonomous or semi-autonomous robot that provides delivery services. An operator may monitor and take control of the robot remotely in certain situations that the robot cannot resolve by itself such as when it is stuck in an obstacle.

### LITERATURE SURVEY
Due to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, with huge numbers of people entering lockdown at differing times and with many people attempting to self-isolate and socially distance from the general public, the delivery robots present a perfect non-human delivery system. Starship Technologies, a robot manufacturing company was the first to use delivery robots as its core delivery method. Starship was the first company to use delivery robots as its core delivery method.

The starship delivery robots are capable of object identification and can also climb small steps. The route between a vendor and a delivery point might look A-to-B if you plug the locations into a navigation app... but there are extra considerations for a delivery robot, including sidewalks, crossings, driveways, humans, animals, vehicles, and so on.
Starship's robots calculate a route based upon the shortest distance and satellite imagery detailing the route. Each feature on the route (crossings, driveways, etc.) receives a time calculation, which the robot factors into route selection and delivery time.
Over time, the robots build a collaborative memory of an area, creating a wireframe map of constant features (buildings, crossings, statues, pathways, etc.) and ensuring that future journeys through the area are faster. The collaborative area-building makes navigation easier for every robot in the vicinity, with all units contributing to building out the local map.

### GOALS
..

### PROPOSED SYSTEM
Usually, robots are of two types autonomous and semiautonomous. A fully autonomous robot performs tasks on its own without any human interference. While a semi-autonomous robot is a system that can operate autonomously under some conditions but may require human intervention to achieve its assigned goals. Building a fully autonomous delivery robot is very technical and complex, so it would be better to build a semi-autonomous delivery robot that can also be controlled by a human. An Arduino can be used as the brain of the delivery robot. It can be programmed to run automatically using sensors and the   HC-06 Bluetooth module can be used to control the delivery bot manually. A motor driver can be used to control the speed of the motor to which the wheels of the bot are attached. Ultrasonic sensors can be used to detect obstacles and move away from them. This delivery bot can be used to deliver different items in an industry or any workplace.

|----------|----------------------------|---------------------|----------|
|  01.|Male-female jumper wires|The difference between each is in the endpoint of the wire. Male ends have a pin protruding and can plug into things, while female ends do not and are used to plug things into. The difference between Male and Female connectors is simple. Just like people the Male has sticking out a “pin” which he plugs into something. The Females on the other hand have a “hole” in which to receive something, usually a “pin”|![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105161049/168488878-215974b6-7077-44da-a362-7c6d72070666.png)|
|  02.|Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04|The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor uses SONAR to determine the distance of an object just like the bats do. It offers excellent non-contact range detection with high accuracy and stable readings in an easy-to-use package from 2 cm to 400 cm or 1” to 13 feet|![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105161049/168490273-df5d082b-3df8-4be3-a0ea-39def16aaf10.png)|
|  03.|Arduno Mega 2560|The Arduino Mega 2560 is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega2560. It has 54 digital input/output pins (of which 15 can be used as PWM outputs), 16 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button|![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105161049/168490197-d73a0323-0301-4b78-ba74-7ad1af4cc290.png)|
|  05.|Breadboard|A breadboard, or protoboard, is a construction base for prototyping electronics. Originally the word referred to a literal breadboard, a polished piece of wood used when slicing bread Because the solderless breadboard does not require soldering, it is reusable.|![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105161049/168489239-04626e55-0484-4cf0-ab46-4fde2ff25d62.png)|
|  06.|USB Cable|The term USB stands for "Universal Serial Bus". USB cable assemblies are some of the most popular cable types available, used mostly to connect computers to peripheral devices such as cameras, camcorders, printers, scanners, and more.|![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105161049/168489317-de490ad3-f497-4505-9c0f-e7261812f9b0.png)
|  07.|Servo Motor|Servo motor works on the PWM (Pulse width modulation) principle, which means its angle of rotation is controlled by the duration of applied pulse to its Control PIN. Basically servo motor is made up of a DC motor which is controlled by a variable resistor (potentiometer) and some gears.|![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105161049/168490099-496d3acd-a770-4834-a919-34dbaabc3761.png)
|  08.|DC Motor|A DC motor (Direct Current motor) is the most common type of motor. DC motors normally have just two leads, one positive and one negative. If you connect these two leads directly to a battery, the motor will rotate. If you switch the leads, the motor will rotate in the opposite direction.|![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105161049/168490505-a92a2058-6e0e-4f87-96f9-82831c2dfecc.png)|
|  09.|Motor Driver L298n|The L298N is a dual H-Bridge motor driver which allows speed and direction control of two DC motors at the same time. The module can drive DC motors that have voltages between 5 and 35V, with a peak current up to 2A.|![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105161049/168491355-da117820-ca61-415a-9c46-44f706d313cd.png).
|  10.|HC-06 Bluetooth Module|The HC-06 is a class 2 slave Bluetooth module designed for transparent wireless serial communication. Once it is paired to a master Bluetooth device such as a PC, smartphone or tablet, its operation becomes transparent to the user. All data received through the serial input is immediately transmitted over the air.|![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105161049/168491611-77a19f48-3190-42ca-aeb8-1a72c727319a.png)|
