## ABOUT ENGINEERING EXPLORATION:
The opportunity to explore materials and discover their potential is constantly evolving. An inquisitive mind is needed to ensure that materials continue to push creative boundaries while remaining functional under the decorative we deal with the project using mechatronics components.

This module aims to move from defining the problem to designing a solution. We begin by learning about the exploration phase, and we will exit this phase with several design concepts for peer review. We also know how to decompose a design to evaluate its overall function and essential process in creating good design essential to the life of our design. Finally, we learn how to critically examine past design artifacts to inform our current concepts so that we can sensibly differentiate our product.

From this, we build trust among our teammates, which also helps in personality development and individual self-confidence and coordination among us.

### NEED STATEMENT
Some industry needs a bot that can deliver different items to employees and workers.
### INTRODUCTION
A robot is a machine, especially one programmable by a computerâ€”capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. A robot can be guided by an external control device, or the control may be embedded within. A robot can execute one or more number tasks with speed and precision. A robot is maybe autonomous or semi-autonomous. A delivery robot is an autonomous or semi-autonomous robot that provides delivery services. An operator may monitor and take control of the robot remotely in certain situations that the robot cannot resolve by itself such as when it is stuck in an obstacle.

### LITERATURE SURVEY
Due to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, with huge numbers of people entering lockdown at differing times and with many people attempting to self-isolate and socially distance from the general public, the delivery robots present a perfect non-human delivery system. Starship Technologies, a robot manufacturing company was the first to use delivery robots as its core delivery method. Starship was the first company to use delivery robots as its core delivery method.

The starship delivery robots are capable of object identification and can also climb small steps. The route between a vendor and a delivery point might look A-to-B if you plug the locations into a navigation app... but there are extra considerations for a delivery robot, including sidewalks, crossings, driveways, humans, animals, vehicles, and so on.
Starship's robots calculate a route based upon the shortest distance and satellite imagery detailing the route. Each feature on the route (crossings, driveways, etc.) receives a time calculation, which the robot factors into route selection and delivery time.
Over time, the robots build a collaborative memory of an area, creating a wireframe map of constant features (buildings, crossings, statues, pathways, etc.) and ensuring that future journeys through the area are faster. The collaborative area-building makes navigation easier for every robot in the vicinity, with all units contributing to building out the local map.

### GOALS
..

### PROPOSED SYSTEM
Usually, robots are of two types autonomous and semiautonomous. A fully autonomous robot performs tasks on its own without any human interference. While a semi-autonomous robot is a system that can operate autonomously under some conditions but may require human intervention to achieve its assigned goals. Building a fully autonomous delivery robot is very technical and complex, so it would be better to build a semi-autonomous delivery robot that can also be controlled by a human. An Arduino can be used as the brain of the delivery robot. It can be programmed to run automatically using sensors and the   HC-06 Bluetooth module can be used to control the delivery bot manually. A motor driver can be used to control the speed of the motor to which the wheels of the bot are attached. Ultrasonic sensors can be used to detect obstacles and move away from them. This delivery bot can be used to deliver different items in an industry or any workplace.
